ðŸ“” I like to write, and I like to code, so there's nothing better than making some [interactive fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction)! So far, there are still pages, options, and endings which have to be implemented, as well as the fighting and the inventory scheme. If you'd like to keep an air of mystery around the plot, I'd recommend not peeking at the code then.
